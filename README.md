# **Facial recognition security app**

Security application that allows users to protect their apps with facial recognition.

## **Description**

This project is a Python application that allows user's to sign in, manage what apps they want protected, and enable facial recognition to verify if
a user is allowed to open those protected apps. The facial recognition utilizes machine learning with a siamese neural network being used to 
calculate the differences between the user's webcam image and the verification images saved to the app. Created as an alternative to other
security apps that don't use biometric data.

## **Known issues and future development**

Issues:

1. Background processes of protected apps may prompt the user for verification while the monitor window is open.

Future development:

Development on bug fixes are on going and will be added as soon as possible.
